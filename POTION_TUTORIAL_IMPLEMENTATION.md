# Potion Master Game Progress Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive game progress tracking system for the Potion Master game with a dedicated database table. Players who complete the tutorial once will skip it on subsequent visits, and all game statistics are tracked.

## Database Schema

### New Table: `potion_game_progress`
A dedicated table for tracking all Potion Master game data per player.

**Columns:**
- `id` - Primary key (auto-increment)
- `student_id` - Foreign key to auth.users (unique per student)
- `has_seen_tutorial` - Boolean flag for tutorial completion
- `total_score` - Cumulative score across all sessions
- `potions_brewed` - Total number of potions successfully created
- `perfect_potions` - Count of perfectly brewed potions
- `failed_attempts` - Number of failed potion attempts
- `highest_streak` - Best consecutive success streak
- `current_streak` - Current consecutive success streak
- `total_time_played` - Total time in seconds spent playing
- `last_played_at` - Timestamp of last game session
- `created_at` - Record creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp (auto-updated via trigger)

**Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Students can view/update only their own progress
- Teachers can view all students' progress
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp via database trigger
- Unique constraint on `student_id` (one record per student)

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File:** `lib/database.types.ts`
- Removed `has_seen_potion_tutorial` from `story_progress` table
- Added complete `potion_game_progress` table definition with all columns

### 2. SQL Migration
**File:** `create-potion-game-progress-table.sql`
- Creates `potion_game_progress` table with all tracking columns
- Adds RLS policies for students and teachers
- Creates trigger for automatic `updated_at` timestamp
- Adds index for faster student lookups
- **Action Required:** Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor

### 3. Potion Master Game Component
**File:** `components/game/potion-master-game.tsx`

#### New State Variables
- `isLoadingTutorialStatus` - Loading state during initial check
- `potionsBrewedCount` - Tracks potions brewed in current session
- `currentStreak` - Tracks current success streak
- `gameStartTime` - Timestamp for calculating session duration

#### New Functions

1. **`initializeProgress()`** - useEffect on component mount
   - Fetches or creates player's progress record
   - Loads existing score, potions brewed, and streak
   - Checks if tutorial has been seen
   - Creates new progress record if first time player

2. **`updateProgress()`**
   - Updates game statistics in database
   - Called when potions are successfully brewed
   - Called when player fails (resets streak)
   - Tracks total time played per session

3. **`markTutorialAsSeen()`**
   - Updates `has_seen_tutorial` flag to true
   - Called when tutorial is completed

#### Modified Functions

1. **`checkRecipe()`**
   - Now tracks successful potion completions
   - Updates total score, potions brewed, and streak
   - Calls `updateProgress()` with latest stats

2. **`resetGame()`**
   - Resets current streak to 0 on failure
   - Increments failed_attempts counter
   - Updates database with failure stats

#### UI Changes
- Shows loading screen while checking tutorial status
- Persistent score across sessions (loaded from database)
- Score updates in real-time and syncs to database

## Statistics Tracked

### Automatic Tracking
✅ **Total Score** - Cumulative points (10 per perfect potion)
✅ **Potions Brewed** - Total successful completions
✅ **Perfect Potions** - All completed potions count as perfect
✅ **Failed Attempts** - When player clicks "Try Again"
✅ **Current Streak** - Consecutive successes (resets on failure)
✅ **Highest Streak** - Best streak achieved
✅ **Total Time Played** - Session duration in seconds
✅ **Last Played** - Timestamp of most recent session
✅ **Tutorial Status** - Whether tutorial has been completed

### Future Use Cases
- Leaderboards (highest score, longest streak)
- Teacher analytics (student progress tracking)
- Achievement system
- Time-based challenges
- Progress reports

## How It Works

### First Time Player
1. User opens Potion Master game
2. System checks `potion_game_progress` table
3. No record found → Creates new record with defaults
4. `has_seen_tutorial = false` → Shows tutorial
5. User completes tutorial
6. System updates `has_seen_tutorial = true`
7. Each successful potion updates stats
8. Progress persists across sessions

### Returning Player
1. User opens Potion Master game
2. System loads progress record
3. `has_seen_tutorial = true` → Skips tutorial
4. Previous score/stats loaded
5. Game starts immediately
6. Stats continue accumulating from previous sessions

### During Gameplay
- **Success:** +10 score, +1 potion brewed, +1 streak
- **Failure:** +1 failed attempt, streak resets to 0
- **Exit:** Total time played updates in database
- **All changes:** Auto-saved to database in real-time

## Database Setup Instructions

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Create a new query
4. Copy the entire contents of `create-potion-game-progress-table.sql`
5. Paste and run the SQL
6. Verify the table was created in Table Editor

## Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### Students
- ✅ Can SELECT their own progress
- ✅ Can INSERT their own progress (auto-created on first play)
- ✅ Can UPDATE their own progress
- ❌ Cannot view other students' progress

### Teachers
- ✅ Can SELECT all students' progress (for analytics)
- ❌ Cannot modify student progress

## Testing Checklist

### First Time User
- [ ] Open Potion Master game
- [ ] Verify tutorial appears with Squeaks
- [ ] Complete all tutorial dialogues
- [ ] Check database: `has_seen_tutorial = true`
- [ ] Verify progress record created

### Returning User
- [ ] Reopen game after completing tutorial
- [ ] Verify tutorial is skipped
- [ ] Check score persists from previous session
- [ ] Complete a potion
- [ ] Verify stats update in database

### Stats Tracking
- [ ] Complete 3 potions successfully
- [ ] Check: `potions_brewed = 3`, `total_score = 30`, `current_streak = 3`
- [ ] Fail once (wrong recipe)
- [ ] Check: `failed_attempts = 1`, `current_streak = 0`
- [ ] Complete 2 more potions
- [ ] Check: `current_streak = 2`, `highest_streak = 3`

### Manual Reset (for testing)
- [ ] Set `has_seen_tutorial = false` in database
- [ ] Reload game
- [ ] Verify tutorial appears again

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `lib/database.types.ts` - Added potion_game_progress table types
- ✅ `components/game/potion-master-game.tsx` - Complete progress tracking
- ✅ `create-potion-game-progress-table.sql` - Database migration (NEW)
- ✅ `POTION_TUTORIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation (UPDATED)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- **Leaderboard Component:** Display top scores and longest streaks
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Teacher view of all students' stats
- **Achievements System:** Badges for milestones (100 potions, 10-streak, etc.)
- **Daily Challenges:** Special recipes with bonus points
- **Time Trials:** Speed-based scoring
- **Difficulty Levels:** Easy/Medium/Hard recipes
- **Tutorial Replay:** Button to re-watch tutorial if needed

### Additional Stats to Track
- Average time per potion
- Most used ladle fractions
- Hardest recipe types (addition vs subtraction)
- Session history (separate table for detailed logs)

## Notes
- Progress saves automatically - no manual save button needed
- Works offline-first, syncs when connection available
- Independent from story_progress table
- Teachers can export stats for reporting
- Future-proof schema allows adding more columns easily
